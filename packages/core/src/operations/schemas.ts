/**
 * Handwritten request schemas, keyed by `Operation.id`. An operation appears here **only** if it
 * is also marked `validation: "strict"` in `overrides.ts`, and the merge fails loudly if the two
 * disagree — a strict operation with no schema is this feature silently doing nothing.
 *
 * Kept apart from `overrides.ts` because an override is data merged into an `Operation` and a
 * schema is code: it cannot be written into `generated.ts` or compared by `catalog:check`.
 *
 * **Every schema here cites the Braze page it was read from, and encodes nothing that page does
 * not state.** A wrong strict schema refuses a request Braze would have accepted, and the caller
 * has no way to overrule it except `braze api`. Where a page leaves a rule ambiguous, the
 * operation stays `generated` and this file says why — a smaller strict set that is right beats a
 * fuller one that guesses.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here, and why:
 *
 * - `messages.send.create` — the identifier rules interact with audience, segment and recipient
 *   objects in ways the docs state across several pages. Ambiguous, so it stays `generated`.
 * - `campaigns.trigger.send.create` — same shape of problem: `recipients` overlaps `audience` and
 *   the "at least one" rule is not stated in one place.
